# Structural Bracket Design and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and structural analysis of an aluminum mounting bracket for industrial equipment.

## Engineering Problem
The bracket must support a vertical load of 500N with minimal deformation.

## Tools
- SolidWorks (CAD & Simulation)
- Python (post-processing)

## Methodology
1. 3D modeling
2. Material assignment
3. Load and boundary conditions
4. Simulation
5. Result analysis

## Results
(Max stress, displacement, safety factor)

## Engineering Conclusion
Design meets structural requirements.
